There are different variations of cards and hands in POKER game. The poker player has 5 cards in his hands.

- Royal-flush: ten, jack, queen, king, and ace, all of the same suit
- Straight flush: five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit
- Four of a kind: four cards of the same rank
- Full house: three cards of the same rank, and two of a second rank
- Flush: five cards of the same suit, not sequential rank
- Straight: five cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit
- Three of a kind: three cards of the same rank, no other matches
- Two pair: two pairs of cards, of two different ranks
- Pair: two cards of the same rank, no other matches
- Nothing: none of the above

 Example (poker-value '(s2 d3 s4 d2 h2)) result THREE OF TWOS
 Example (poker-value '(s2 s3 s4 s6 s5)) result STRAIGHT FLUSH - SPADES
